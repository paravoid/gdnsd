gdnsd (1.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes FTBFS on sparc64, thanks to Aurelien Jarno for the help.
    - Test suite more resilient to slow build hosts, helps with a couple of
      FTBFS on slow architectures (e.g. sh4).
  * Drop dependency on libnet-dns-perl & update debian/copyright. Newer
    Net::DNS versions broke the internal API, gdnsd now bundles parts of 0.68
    for the test suite.
