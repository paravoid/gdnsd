Located here (within the "Net/" subdirectory) is a copy of Net::DNS frozen at
  version 0.68, because incompatible changes were introduced upstream in versions
  0.69 and later.

This copy of 0.68 has a number of trivial, local changes:
  *) The XS version of dn_expand is not included
  *) The XS loading code is gone, to not pick up some incompatible copy
  *) The check for Net::DNS::SEC is removed, as is the (not useful
     to gdnsd) loading of Net::DNS::Update.
  *) All docs and other non-functional miscellany removed
  *) Several sub-modules not used by the testsuite removed to save space,
     but could be added back later if warranted:
